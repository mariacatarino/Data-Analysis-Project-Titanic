# Data Analysis Project: Using parameters to create a new dataset with columns and specific data about Titanic's passengers.
---
### The project uses a dataset with information about all the passengers of the Titanic.
### The objective of the project is to know which were the female passengers of the first class of the vessel who survived.
---
#### The following treatment was done on the dataset:
1. The columns ['Name','Age','Sex','Pclass','Survived'] were selected as essential to be kept in the project.
2. Only examples that had data on surviving first-class women were kept in the dataset, these attributes being mutually mandatory.
3. The Name column has been placed in alphabetical order.
4. At the end, a new dataset was created with the information obtained.
---
### **Conclusion:**
The analysis was useful to be able to create a new dataset with the desired results. The same line of reasoning could be used to create new datasets like:
1. Which passengers, male and female, survived?
2. Which passengers, men and women, died?
3. Which male first class passengers survived?
Among other questions that can be asked in the same dataset or that can serve as a model for similar necessary solutions in other datasets.
